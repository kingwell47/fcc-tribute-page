          Direct videos, such as during a pre-recorded video shown at E3 2012
          when he stared at bananas in silence for several seconds before
          turning to the camera." -

        <h3>Here are some notable years in Mr. Iwata's life and career:</h3>
        <ul class="history">
          <li class="history-item">
            <strong class="year">1959</strong> - Born in Sapporo, Japan.
          </li>
          <li class="history-item">
            <strong class="year">1978</strong> - Admitted to the Tokyo Institute
            for Technology, where he majored in computer science.
          </li>
          <li class="history-item">
            <strong class="year">1982</strong> - Started working full-time for
            HAL Laboratory (HAL), after previously working there part-time while
            studying.
          </li>
          <li class="history-item">
            <strong class="year">1983</strong> - Became coordinator of software
            production for HAL, where he helped create a relationship with
            Nintendo to be able to produce games for the Nintendo Entertainment
            System (NES). He worked on the NES port for the arcade game Joust,
            as well as games such as Balloon Fight, NES Open Tournament Golf,
            Earthbound and the Kirby games. His work on NES Open Tournament Golf
            is particularly noteworthy as Iwata had to create his own data
            compression method in order to fit all 18 courses into the game, a
            feat that Nintendo did not believe was possible at that time.
          </li>
          <li class="history-item">
            <strong class="year">1993</strong> - Promoted to president of HAL at
            the insistence of Nintendo's then-President, Hiroshi Yamauchi. With
            assistance from Nintendo, Iwata helped turn the company around from
            its ¥1.5 billion debt and stabilize its finances within six years.
          </li>
          <li class="history-item">
            <strong class="year">1999</strong> - Assisted in the development of
            Pokémon Gold and Silver for the Game Boy Color, by creating a set of
            compression tools utilized for graphics in the games. According to
            Tsunekazu Ishihara, the president of The Pokémon Company, Iwata was
            instrumental in bringing Pokémon to Western markets.
          </li>
          <li class="history-item">
            <strong class="year">2000</strong> - Joined Nintendo as the head of
            its corporate planning division and took a seat on the board of
            directors. Over the next two years, he sought to reduce the cost and
            length of game development while preserving quality.
          </li>
          <li class="history-item">
            <strong class="year">2002</strong> - Succeeded as Nintendo's fourth
            president with Hiroshi Yamauchi's blessing. He was the first
            Nintendo president unrelated to the Yamauchi family through blood or
            marriage since its founding in 1889.
          </li>
          <li class="history-item">
            <strong class="year">2004</strong> - Helped lead a revitalization of
            Nintendo's handheld business by transitioning the company from the
            Game Boy Advance to the Nintendo DS. The Nintendo DS proved to be a
            highly profitable system and went on to become the second-best
            selling video game console of all time with more than 154 million
            units, inclusive of subsequent iterations, sold by September 2014.
          </li>
          <li class="history-item">
            <strong class="year">2006</strong> - Nintendo launches the Nintendo
            Wii. The controller's remote control design partially stemmed from
            Iwata's desire to have a device that was "immediately accessible" to
            all. He also insisted that the Wii Remote be referred to as simply a
            "remote" rather than a controller to emphasize its accessibility to
            anyone. The Wii ultimately popularized the use of motion
            control-based video games and proved highly successful for Nintendo,
            helping to nearly double the company's stock price.
          </li>
          <li class="history-item">
            <strong class="year">2010</strong> - Subsequent hardware units under
            Iwata's tenure, including the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, were not as
            successful as the DS and Wii, and Nintendo's finances took a
            downward turn. Iwata voluntarily halves his salary in 2011 and 2014
            as apologies for the poor sales while other members of the Nintendo
            board of directors had pay cuts of 20 to 30 percent.
          </li>
          <li class="history-item">
            <strong class="year">2015</strong> - Was hospitalized and ultimately
            dies due to complications from a bile duct tumor at the age of 55.
            Despite his hospitalization, Iwata continued to work via his laptop
            in his bed and provided feedback on Pokémon Go.
          </li>
          <li class="history-item">
            <strong class="year">2017</strong> - Nintendo launches the Nintendo
            Switch, where Iwata served as the console's head developer during
            the final months of his life. As of June 30, 2022, Nintendo has
            shipped 111.08 million Switch units, with over 84.77 million
            original Switch units, 18.99 million Switch Lite units, and 7.32
            million Switch OLED units. With these numbers the Switch has
            surpassed lifetime sales of the Wii U (13.6 million units), GameCube
            (21.7 million units), Nintendo 64 (32.9 million units), Super
            Nintendo Entertainment System (49.1 million units), Nintendo
            Entertainment System (61.9 million units), Nintendo 3DS (75.92
            million units), Game Boy Advance (81.51 million units), and Wii
            (101.63 million units).
